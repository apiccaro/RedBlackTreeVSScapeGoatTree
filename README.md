# RedBlackTreeVSScapeGoatTree
A comparison between 3 self balancing trees: AVL Trees, Red Black Trees and Scape Goat Trees. This discussion compares the trees efficiency to sort large amounts of data. We tested this by counting the number of rotations, time to insert and time to search in each tree with the same amount of data. We completed this exploration in each function to ultimately determine the most efficient self balancing tree of the three. By plotting the number of rotations, time to insert and time to search versus the size of data over several iterations of exponentially increasing sizes of data, we were able to determine which tree is most efficient in each subcategory.

Included is the presentation we presented our findings to our fellow Data Structures and Algorithms classmates.


Included in each tree is a visualization software that creates .png files to see what nodes are added and how they are sorted.
A more detailed README of how to run the Jupyter Notebooks and visualization is in pdf form. 

Contributors:

Fremont Forseberg:
Created the tests to compare efficiency and the graphing models, as well as coded the AVL tree we started in class.

Lucy Flannagan:
Coded a Scape Goat tree from scratch.

Annika Piccaro:
Coded a Red Black tree from scratch and created the visualization software.

There was not a completion of a fully working AVL tree to be compared to alongside the Scape Goat and Red-Black Tree. Because of this minor set back we had to compare found time complexities of the AVL tree rather than experimental time complexities.
